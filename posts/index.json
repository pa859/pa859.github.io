    "body": "<div>Look—let's not beat around the bush. We love aliens. Everyone loves aliens. If you're watching a mediocre movie and it turns out to be an Alien movie? It's automatically a million times better. We always want to know what's going on in a world beyond our own, even if usually it's not even somewhat based in reality. Whether it's a world where they're running rampant—like, say Guardians of the Galaxy—or a world where they're basically hunting us down one-by-one—like, say, the entire Alien franchise—an Alien always makes for a great movie hook.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546182208-1e70985e2bf3?ixid=MnwzNDMxMjh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxmaXJlfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2NjQ3MDE3OQ&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;dpr=1&amp;h=400&amp;q=70\" alt=\"image of list item\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><div><br></div><div>But what is it about this trope that we find ourselves so drawn to? Why do we love Alien movies so much, and why does Hollywood love the idea so much that it keeps churning out movies of widely-varying quality? It's probably something of a cross between the idea of otherworldly beings in and of itself, a human being's nature of being drawn to fear, and the curiosity of the unknown. In the case of Jordan Peele's Nope—one of the best movies of 2022—it's all about the addiction and obsession with spectacle. And that's something that's present in varying degrees in just about every wake of life.</div><div><br></div><div>But we also have to be real—it's obviously not always that deep. Sometimes the aliens are just...out to kill us. Other times, they're voiced by Seth Rogen, and hanging out with nerds played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. We're OK with movies like that, too.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578885136359-16c8bd4d3a8e?ixid=MnwzNDMxMjh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxmaXJlfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2NjQ3MDE3OQ&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;dpr=1&amp;h=400&amp;q=70\" alt=\"image of list item\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><div><br></div><div>So whenever you're feeling like you want a peek into a world that's either slightly different or very different from our own, the movies on this list should always be a good bet.</div>",

It was also the last time we would see Fox and LeBoeuf together as the one Transformers couple to rule them all, even though, in a more fair world, they would have rode out the original trilogy together as a beloved pair of star-crossed robot whisperers. We would have had one more movie to hear Fox yell “Saaaaaam!” in her very specific, perfect way.",

Yes. The best part of the movie is when it’s glossed over that Harriet Tubman was part of an underground robot railroad. The rest of the movie is two hours (or ten) of so much more of what you’ve already seen, except more boring. Laura Haddock has an important role in theory as Oxford professor Vivian Wembley, but a descendent of the wizard Merlin (not kidding, the Knights of the Round Table also enter the mythology in T5) should have had far more cool shit to do than just occasionally sass Mark Wahlberg. Nicola Peltz went one and done after Age of Extinction, relegating Cade Yeager’s daughter to just outgoing-message status on a voice-mail.",

A strong Fox allegiance made me wonder, Will the replacement presence of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam’s paramour feel like watching a scab cross the picket line? It did a little bit, but as a dedicated Huntington-Whiteley fan, I was able to open my heart enough to let the love in for Dark of the Moon. That’s basically all thanks to LeBeouf, who managed to turn some franchise paychecks into work he could be proud of. Sam Witwicky is a great hero, and his closing chapter in Dark of the Moon was a strong send-off for the character that really made him a household name. (And also made him tanner than he will ever be again in his natural life.)",

The director actually had the stones to make Wahlberg into a humble inventor and family man named Cade Yeager, who gets a dormant Optimus Prime up and running in his work shed. And not only does he have a new Autobot to deal with while security squads comb the landscape for rogue bots, he’s also got an obstreperous teenage daughter in the form of Nicola Peltz, who is definitely an underage girl with an adult boyfriend.<img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601584115197-04ecc0da31d7?ixid=MnwzNDMxMjh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHx0cnVja3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2NjY0NjkyNzA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;dpr=1&amp;h=400&amp;q=70\" alt=\"image of list item\" loading=\"lazy\">",

We truly feel the fear and abject hunger of vulnerable farmers, so desperate to protect their new crop that they’re paying hired samurai with their last grains of rice.
